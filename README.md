# Predicting-Video-Memorability-Scores

Predicting Video Memorability Scores Using various Machine Learning Models. This project is an attempt on solving "Predicting Media Memorability Task at MediaEval 2018" challege. I have used the dataset provideed by the organisers to train and build the model. The code for this challege was written using python.

Repository organization:

Dataset : Contains one file namely : ground-truth.csv : This file contains the ground truth of memorability scores given to each video.

video_memorability_prediction.ipynb This is the final predictor, that can predict the short-term and long-term memorability scores of any video without using captions with C3D, HMP and Inception v3. The best result for this predictor for predicting the short-term memorability scores is 0.327 for short term and 0.191 for long term.

Additional details and some research on this challenge is described in Published Report.pdf file.
